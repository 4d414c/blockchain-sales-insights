# NFT trading insights through blockchain sales data analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NFT trading data across various blockchains to uncover insights into trading activity.  By leveraging Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the analysis aims to provide a clear view of market trends, including trade volume, number of buyers, sellers, and overall sales across different blockchain networks.

## Data Source
The data used in this project was retrevied using the Dune Analytics API and covers NFT trading metrics such as:
-**Blockchain:** The underlying network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)
-**Buyers & Sellers:** Number of participants in transactions
-**Sales:** Number of sales recorded
-**Voluem (USD):** Total trade volume in US dollars

## Analysis & Visualizations
The project includes:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, etc.)
- Descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution
- Visualizations (e.g. bar charts) to highlight trading insights

## Future Work
- Further analysis of trends over time
- Advanced visualizations and predictive modeling
- Integration of additional datasets for deeper insights

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries ('pandas', 'matplotlib').
3. Run the notebook or scripts provided to reproduce the analysis.

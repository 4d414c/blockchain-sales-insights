# NFT trading insights through blockchain sales data analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NFT trading data across various blockchains to uncover insights into trading activity.  Leveraging Pandas and Matplotlib in Python, the project aims to analyze market trends, including trade volume, number of buyers, sellers, and overall sales across different blockchain networks.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset, retrieved using Dune Analytics API, contains NFT trading metrics across multiple blockchains.  It includes the following key fields:
- **Blockchain** - The underlying network where the transaction occurred (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).
- **Date** - The transaction date.
- **Buyers & Sellers** - The number of unique participants in transactions.
- **Sales** - The total number of NFT sales recorded.
- **Volume (USD)** - The total trade volume in US dollars.

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmmalcolmjones/dune-nft-trades-data).

## Analysis & Visualizations
The project includes:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, data formatting, etc.).
- Descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
- Visualizations (e.g., bar charts) to highlight key NFT trading insights.

These analyses provide insights into the most active blockchains, buyer/seller behavior, and overall market activity.

## Future Work
- Further analysis of trends over time.
- Advanced visualizations and predictive modeling.
- Integration of additional datasets for deeper insights.
